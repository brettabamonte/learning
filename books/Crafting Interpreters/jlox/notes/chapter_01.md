## Challenges

2. This informal introduction leaves a lot unspecified. List several open questions you have about the languageâ€™s syntax and semantics. What do you think the answers should be?
 - Do switch statements fall-through?
 - Operator overloading
 - Method overloading
 - Does adding a property to a class instance affect the class?


3. Lox is a pretty tiny language. What features do you think it is missing that would make it annoying to use for real programs? (Aside from the standard library, of course.)

  - Built-in data structures like arrays, maps, and sets
  - Higher-order functions like map, reduce
  - Custom data types like structs
  - Interfaces to promote polymorphism
  - Language tooling such as formatting, etc
